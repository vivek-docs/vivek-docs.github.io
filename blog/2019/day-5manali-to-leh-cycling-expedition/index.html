You have to cut across these streams by wading through its ice-cold water. The flow of these streams increases as the temperature rises, hence it is advisable to cross such streams before noon. If you feel the current of the stream is too powerful to cross, it is advisable to go back and halt at Upper ZingZingBar and cross the nala next morning. This particular Nala is difficult to cross not just by motorcycles, but by Army 4x4 trucks too.</p> <iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FSh_OVV-OSmE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSh_OVV-OSmE&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FSh_OVV-OSmE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/2fc8af4126dbb7d2b00135dcebf2b60e/href" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://medium.com/media/2fc8af4126dbb7d2b00135dcebf2b60e/href</a></iframe> <p>We crossed this Nala early in the morning. We first carried our panniers to the other side, and then lifted our cycles, one cycle at a time with the help of two cyclist because the water current was too strong. For motorists, riders had to take help of two people who stood in the flow of the water to push the motorcycle out.</p> <p><strong><em>Important tip </em></strong>— If you are on self-supported bike or car tour without a local guide, cross the nala from the same path where everyone else is crossing, do not deviate from the main road. Some people try to find out a less difficult route to cross the nala by going further down the slope and get stuck there. If you are out of reach of the main road, you are on your own and have to struggle to come out, be careful.</p> <blockquote> <strong>Quick facts</strong><br>• <strong>Day 5 </strong>— Manali to Leh cycling <br>• <strong>Route followed </strong>— Upper Zingzingbar &gt; Baralacha La &gt; Bharatpur &gt; Sarchu<br>• <strong>Distance covered </strong>— 54 km <br>• <strong>Altitude gained </strong>— Total altitude gained is <strong>2490 </strong>ft.

Suraj Tal is the third highest lake in India, and the 21st-highest in the world. Suraj Tal Lake is the source of Bhaga River which joins the Chandra River downstream at Tandi to form the Chandrabhaga River in Himachal Pradesh territory, and as it enters Jammu and Kashmir it is renamed as the Chenab River. The other major tributary of the Chandrabhaga, the Chandra originates from the glacier close to the Chandra Taal lake in the Spiti district.
