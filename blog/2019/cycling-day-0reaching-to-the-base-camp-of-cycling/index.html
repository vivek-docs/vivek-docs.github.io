The distance from Delhi to Manali is approximately 538 km. Alternatively, you can fly from Delhi to Kullu and from Kullu travel to Manali by road. The distance from Kullu to Manali is approximately 50 km.</p> <h4><strong>How we traveled to Manali</strong></h4> <p>We decided to fly to Delhi and from Delhi we took a bus for Manali. We traveled by the <a href="http://online.hrtchp.com/oprs-web/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Himachal Road Transport Corporation</a> bus. We booked tickets for a Volvo bus two weeks in advance. However, the bus got cancelled at the last moment due to a land slide near Manali, which caused all the returning buses to halt at Manali.</p> <p>This was the beginning of our adventure which started with boarding an ordinary bus, instead of a luxury Volvo bus. The bus journey was exhaustive for us. However, it is recommended to travel by bus so that you gain the altitude of Manali slowly as compared to flying to Kullu. After reaching to Manali, we went to Jagatsukh, where Mr. Raju Sharma provided us accommodation and bicycles on rent.</p> <h4><strong>How we arranged our cycles</strong></h4> <p>To avoid the hassle of logistics, we conveniently rented out cycles from Mr. Raju Sharma. However, many — domestic as well as overseas — cyclists prefer to bring their own cycles with them. If you prefer to transport your cycle with you, you will have to disassemble it and box it. In Manali, there are a number of cycle shops which can unbox and reassemble your cycle for you for a minimum fee.</p> <blockquote> <strong><em>Quick tip</em></strong><em> </em><br>Make sure that you rest for a day in Manali to relax and to get acclimatized. After taking some rest, you can go for a test cycle ride around Manali just to make yourself familiar with the surroundings.</blockquote> <p>And our journey continued on this misty road for the next 8 days.
