If you start your day at Jispa, it is advisable to stop at Upper ZingZingBar to avoid covering too much altitude on the same day. As you proceed from Jispa to ZingZingBar, the landscape changes from greener to dryer. While traveling to Upper Zingzingbar, note that accommodation is not available Patsio for travelers.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KPF6dx8Jt97Datj4Kb_upg.jpeg"><figcaption>Highlight of this route —the beautiful Deepak Taal (lake) at the altitude of 12303 ft. It gets it’s ice cold water from the melting glaciers.</figcaption></figure> <p>Upper Zingzingbar is a temporary camp site mainly used by BRO road workers and tourist, it is an uninhabited place. There are temporary tent Dhabas where you can comfortably spend your night. We stayed at PEACE café.</p> <p>At Upper ZingZingbar, to our pleasant surprise, we met with two separate groups of cyclists. We met Gabbi, Truven, and Mica who were from Spain and Nitesh who was from Goa and he was a solo cyclist.</p> <p>After exchanging social pleasantries with Spanish cyclists, the conversation sparked up around cycling, types of cycles, their itineraries, experiences they had as overseas cyclists in India, and the talks went on till bed time. For desserts, we all had home made dry fruit laddus, which we carried with us. After that we tasted the cheese which Truven got from Spain. When asked what’s so special about this cheese, he said this cheese reminds him of home and he carries it on every international cycling trip, just to avoid home sickness. Indeed, the cheese was tasty.</p> <p>Nitesh was a solo cyclist. It was very courageous of him to cycle all alone on this almost deserted highway. He followed his own cycling itinerary, stopped where he felt like, enjoyed his solitude with nature, and captured beautiful moments. Just to enjoy his cycling tour to the fullest, unlike us, he did not book his return ticket in advance. After cycling to Leh, Nitesh went on to explore Jammu and Kashmir.
