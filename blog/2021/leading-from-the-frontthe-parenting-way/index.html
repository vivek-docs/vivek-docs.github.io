I wonder how my love for outdoor got transferred into my kids without even I making any efforts for that.</figcaption></figure> <p>While on a leisurely bike ride, some thoughts came to my mind on how to make my kids successful in their personal and professional lives. How do I make them understand what are the right things to do in life? What are the basic human qualities they should pursue to be the best version of themselves? And the thought lingered.</p> <p>I saw some of my friends and relatives worrying too much about this aspect of parenting. They focus more on their kids’ behaviour than observing their own actions. Many times, kids are overwhelmed by their parents’ expectations. I find it unnecessary to force kids to be studious or religious at a very young age. I argued and tried to find the right answer whether to let kids form their own opinion of the world or make them think and act the way we want.</p> <p>Then I turned to Khalil Gibran for an answer -</p> <blockquote>You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts.</blockquote> <blockquote>You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.</blockquote> <p>To understand how to teach my kids to build their lives in a better way, I turned inward and started examining how I became what I am today, at spiritual, social, and professional levels.</p> <p>I became a spiritual person, not by following my parents’ religious beliefs, but by observing their dedication and love for a higher cause. I almost always rejected their religious rituals, but their thoughts of kindness, love, and care for all made me a better person.</p> <p>When it came to my career, I never listened to my elder brother, but his dedication to get into one of the best tech institutes in the world inspired me to do my best. I feel no amount of external motivation could have taken me where I am, if not for the impression of my brother’s Karma on my mind.</p> <p>On the professional front, I learnt how to get the work done and still be kind, patient, and empathetic by observing one of my best bosses. Also, I learnt what not to be by observing the other kind of bosses I worked with.</p> <p>Life taught me that to inculcate good qualities in my kids I need to lead from the front. I must show them how it’s done. I may not be the perfect one, but my actions should reflect what I believe in. Kids learn by observing their parents, and not by listening to their instructions. Be the change you want to see in your kids!</p> <p>Agree with me? Do let me know your thoughts on how to raise kids.</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ca91dfa31017" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
